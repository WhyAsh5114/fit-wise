## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Input your goals** → muscle gain, fat loss, mobility, etc.
2. **AI Agent** queries the RAG system to retrieve relevant exercise science and anatomy research.
3. **AI crafts a plan** → exercises, reps, rest times based on evidence-based recommendations.
4. **Webcam activates** during your workout to detect posture.
5. **Live feedback** guides your form using biomechanics knowledge, preventing injuries and bad habits.
