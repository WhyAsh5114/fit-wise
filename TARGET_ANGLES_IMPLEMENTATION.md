# Target Angle Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of `targetLowAngle` and `targetHighAngle` features in the FitWise application.

## Overview

Added target angle guidance to help users achieve optimal range of motion (ROM) for exercises. The LLM now generates target angle ranges based on user preferences, and the feedback system uses these targets to provide more personalized guidance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates

**File: `src/routes/api/exercise-config/+server.ts`**
- Added `targetLowAngle` and `targetHighAngle` to `AngleConfigSchema`
- Updated AI prompt with biomechanical target ranges and ROM focus instructions
- Added support for `romFocus` parameter (low, standard, high, maximum)

**File: `src/lib/workout-utils.ts`**
- Updated `AngleConfig` type to include target angle fields
- Modified `processExerciseReps` to accept optional preloaded exercise config
- Updated predefined exercise configurations with realistic target ranges:
  - Bicep curl: 45° - 150° 
  - Squat: 90° - 170°
  - Push-up: 60° - 160°

### 2. Performance Optimization

**File: `src/lib/workout-utils.ts`**
- Enhanced `processExerciseReps` function to accept preloaded exercise configurations
- Eliminates need for LLM calls during real-time exercise tracking
- Maintains backward compatibility with automatic config generation

**File: `src/routes/(app)/form-analysis/+page.svelte`**
- Updated to use preloaded exercise configs from saved workouts
- Significantly improves performance during live exercise tracking
- Ensures consistent target angles across workout sessions

### 2. Feedback System Enhancement

**File: `src/lib/types/feedback.ts`**
- Added optional `targetAngles` field to `WorkoutFeedbackInputSchema`

**File: `src/routes/api/feedback/+server.ts`**
- Enhanced feedback prompt to utilize target angle information
- Added ROM achievement percentage calculation
- Improved scoring logic to reward target range achievement

**File: `src/lib/workout-utils.ts`**
- Modified `processRepSegment` to calculate and pass target angles to feedback API
- Averages target ranges from all angle configurations for comprehensive guidance

### 3. UI Improvements

**File: `src/routes/(app)/generate-exercise-config/+page.svelte`**
- Added ROM Focus selector with 4 levels:
  - **Low**: Conservative for beginners (reduces target ROM by 20-30%)
  - **Standard**: Average fitness level (default ranges)
  - **High**: Extended for advanced users (increases target ROM by 20-30%)
  - **Maximum**: Elite athletes (increases target ROM by 40-50%)
- Updated display to show target angles with visual ROM indicators

**File: `src/routes/(app)/exercise-configs/[id]/+page.svelte`**
- Enhanced angle configuration display to show target ranges
- Added color-coded indicators for target angle information

## Target Angle Examples

The LLM generates biomechanically appropriate target ranges:

### Bicep Curl
- **Standard ROM**: 45° - 150° (105° range)
- **High ROM**: ~30° - 165° (135° range)
- **Low ROM**: ~60° - 135° (75° range)

### Squat
- **Standard ROM**: 90° - 170° (80° range)
- **High ROM**: ~70° - 175° (105° range)  
- **Low ROM**: ~105° - 165° (60° range)

### Push-up
- **Standard ROM**: 60° - 160° (100° range)
- **High ROM**: ~45° - 170° (125° range)
- **Low ROM**: ~75° - 150° (75° range)

## How It Works

1. **Configuration Generation**: User selects ROM focus, LLM generates appropriate target angles
2. **Exercise Tracking**: System tracks actual angle ranges during exercise
3. **Feedback Generation**: AI compares achieved ROM to target ranges
4. **User Guidance**: Feedback encourages deeper/higher ROM or praises excellent mobility

## Benefits

- **Personalized Guidance**: ROM targets adapt to user fitness level
- **Progressive Improvement**: Users can advance ROM focus as mobility improves
- **Injury Prevention**: Conservative targets for beginners, safe maximums for advanced
- **Motivation**: Clear targets and achievement percentages encourage progress
- **Performance Optimization**: Preloaded configs eliminate LLM calls during exercise tracking
- **Consistency**: Same target angles used throughout entire workout session
- **Reliability**: No dependency on external AI services during live tracking

## Testing

Created test files to validate functionality:
- `test-target-angles.js`: Tests config generation with different ROM focuses
- `test-target-angle-feedback.js`: Tests feedback system with various ROM achievements

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- User-specific ROM progression tracking
- Dynamic target adjustment based on performance history
- Integration with physiotherapy protocols
- Visual ROM progress charts
